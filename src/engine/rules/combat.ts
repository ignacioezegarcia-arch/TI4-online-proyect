/**
 * RR 61 (space combat) / RR 38 (ground combat) — presence queries.
 *
 * Ported from the original class-based src/engine/combatAreas.js
 * (SpaceArea/GroundArea). Most of that file's actual job is now done by
 * GameState's plain data shape directly — SystemState.spaceUnitsByPlayer and
 * PlanetState.unitsByPlayer already ARE the "who has units here" map that
 * SpaceArea/GroundArea used to wrap in a class. These are the two presence
 * queries still worth having as named, shared functions rather than
 * re-writing the same filter/reduce at every call site.
